eeshow - Eeschema schematics renderer and viewer
================================================

Eeshow renders schematics made by KiCad Eeschema to FIG, PDF, or PNG,
and generates graphical differences between different versions of
schematics sheets. It can work in plain files but it can also
retrieve design files directly from a git repository. Furthermore,
eeshow has an interactive mode for viewing schematics and differences.
